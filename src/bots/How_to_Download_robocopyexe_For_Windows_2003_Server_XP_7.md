## Some Tips and Tricks for Using Robocopy
 
Robocopy is a versatile tool that can handle various copying tasks and scenarios. Here are some tips and tricks that can help you use robocopy more effectively and efficiently.
 
### Use /MIR to Mirror a Directory Tree
 
If you want to copy an entire directory tree from the source to the destination, and also delete any files or folders in the destination that are not present in the source, you can use the /MIR option. This option is equivalent to using /E and /PURGE together. For example, to mirror the contents of c:\backup to \\server\share, type:

    robocopy c:\backup "\\server\share" /MIR

Be careful when using this option, as it can delete files or folders that you may want to keep in the destination.
 
### Use /L to List Files Without Copying
 
If you want to see what files or folders robocopy will copy or delete without actually performing the operation, you can use the /L option. This option will list the files or folders that would be copied or deleted, along with their sizes and timestamps. For example, to list the files or folders that would be copied from c:\reports to \\marketing\videos, type:

    robocopy c:\reports "\\marketing\videos" /L

This option is useful for testing and verifying your robocopy commands before executing them.
 
### Use /LOG to Save Output to a File
 
If you want to save the output of robocopy to a file for later review or analysis, you can use the /LOG option. This option will create a log file with the specified name and append the output of robocopy to it. For example, to save the output of robocopy from c:\reports to \\marketing\videos to a file named robolog.txt, type:

    robocopy c:\reports "\\marketing\videos" /LOG:robolog.txt

You can also use the /LOG+ option to append the output of robocopy to an existing log file instead of overwriting it.
 
### Use /R and /W to Control Retry Options
 
If robocopy encounters an error while copying a file or folder, such as network interruption or access denied, it will retry the operation by default. You can use the /R and /W options to control how many times and how long robocopy will retry before giving up. For example, to set robocopy to retry 5 times with a 10-second wait between each retry, type:

    robocopy c:\reports "\\marketing\videos" /R:5 /W:10

You can also use /R:0 or /W:0 to disable retrying altogether.
